 About FEvoR
=============

FEvoR is a statistical fabric evolution model that includes 
recrystallization processes such as:
    Grain Growth
    Polygonization
    Migration Recrstallization

FEvoR was devoloped at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) by 
Joseph H Kennedy. For a detailed description of this model, see:

    history. Journal of Glaciology, 59(214), 357–373.

FEvoR is based on the work by Dr. Thorsteinsson, see:

    aggregates. Journal of Glaciology, 47(158), 507–516.
